My swirl homework notes

Lesson 1 - Basic Building Blocks: I learned how to use R like a calculator, and also learned about how doing different operations works when working with vectors. Finally, I learned how to assign a variable. 

Lesson 2 - Workspace & Files: This lesson taught about how to go in and out of working directories. How to create directories, construct file and directory paths, create files within a directory. What I learned in this lesson is a bit more about how R operates. Previously, I was seeing R as being similar but different to MATLAB, but after this lesson, I would compare R to being closer to Linux. 

Lesson 3 - Sequences of Numbers: This module taught about how to create vectors of different types. I can use the basic 1:2 to create a vector from one to two, but by using by= and length=, I can create different variations of this. I also learned about creating vectors of repeating zeros, variables, etc. 

Lesson 4 - Vectors: In this lesson, I learned about logical and character vectors. A large part of this lesson was focused on using the paste() operator, in which you can join different character vectors. 

Lesson 5 - Missing Values: This time around taught about missing values. It taught about NA and NaN and their use within R. 

Lesson 6 - Subsetting Vectors: I struggled a bit more with understanding this lesson, but it taught about calling for certain parts of a vector. There are 4 different types types of parts of a vector that can be referenced through R, including positive and negative integers, character strings, and logical statements. 

Lesson 7 - Matrices & Data Frames: During this seventh lesson, I learned about creating matrices in different ways. Changing a vector to a matrix by setting up it's dimensions. One thing to note is that coordinates within R use (y,x), which is a bit counterintuitive. 

Lesson 8 - Logic: This module had to do with logical operations including TRUE and FALSE, as well as the logical operators ==, !=, &, &&, |, ||, and the greater than, less than, etc. 

Lesson 9 - Functions: This lesson taught all about writing functions, including placing a function into another function. I struggled with this lesson, will need to study this later. 

Lesson 12 - Looking at Data: The final lesson of this homework talked about the ways to look at or pull information from a data set.
